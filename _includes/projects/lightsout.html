<!-- Lights Out App -->
<p>
    My Lights Out app is based on the 1995 handheld electronic game by Tiger
    Electronics of the same name. In the 1995 version, the game board consists
    of a 5x5 grid of lights, and then when game starts, a seemingly random
    pattern of lights is presented to the player. The player's objective is to
    toggle lights to turn all the lights off with button presses, preferably in
    as few presses as possible.
</p>
<p>
    When a light is pressed, the on/off state of the pressed light and all
    directly adjacent lights are toggled.

    Although similar handheld games and apps already exists. There are two
    things that I believe make my app unique: variable board sizes, and
    mathematical optimization.
</p>
<h3 class="text-uppercase text-black">Variable Board Sizes</h3>

<p>
    Many of the apps available today only feature a single board size, usually
    the classic 5x5. This makes the app less challenging once the user finds a
    reliable method for solving the single board size and limits the number of
    possible scrambles. For the 5x5 board, there are 2<sup>23</sup>=8388608
    distinct ways to create a scramble. However, there are at least 4 different
    ways to create any given scramble, leaving at most 2<sup>19</sup>=524288
    unique scrambles. All of these scrambles can be solved in at most 15 button
    presses.
</p>

<p>
    My app allows user to play any board size from the trivial 1x1 to the
    daunting 10x10, providing orders of magnitude more unique scrambles than the
    5x5 alone. I would have allowed even larges sizes, but the buttons were
    getting too small to reliably press.
</p>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-3 offset-md-3">
        <img
            src="/assets/Images/Projects/Java/levelSelect.jpg"
            alt="Level selection"
        />
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-3">
        <img
            src="/assets/Images/Projects/Java/10x10.jpg"
            alt="A scrambled 10x10 board"
        />
    </div>
</div>

<p>
    In fact, just the 10x10 size has 2<sup>100</sup>, over 1 nonillion unique
    scrambles. For comparison, if each unique board were printed on a sheet of
    paper 0.1 mm thick, the stack of paper would reach to the edge of the
    observable universe 13.4 billion light years away.
</p>

<p>
    Users have yet another dimension opened to them in being able to play by
    only pressing buttons that are already on. Although all puzzles that can be
    solved normally can also be solved by only pressing on buttons, it makes for
    a much more difficult challenge because the way that most learn to solve the
    5x5 board requires pressing off buttons.
</p>

<h3 class="text-uppercase text-black">Mathematical Optimization</h3>

<p>
    I already mentioned how any 5x5 board can be solved in at most 15 button
    presses. Puzzle enthusiasts and recreational mathematicians like Jaap
    Scherphuis proved this to be the case. Jaap in particular uses a method of
    treating solving the board as a linear algebra problem that is described by
    mathematician Marlow Anderson and Todd Feil in their 1998 paper
    <em>Turning Lights Out with Linear Algebra</em>.
</p>

<p>
    I implemented Anderson and Feil's method of row reducing matrices modulo 2
    to determine the minimum number of clicks needed to solve any given board.
    This way users can know how their solve is compared to the absolute best
    they could do.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-12">
        <img
            src="/assets/Images/Projects/Java/10x10.jpg"
            alt="The minimum for this 10x10 board is 42 clicks"
            style="
                display: block;
                margin-left: auto;
                margin-right: auto;
                max-height: 25em;
            "
        />
    </div>
</div>

<p>
    Although this value is only one number on a screen, I think it provides
    valuable information to users about a given puzzle's difficulty and their
    own solving abilities that no other app has.
</p>

<p>
    The app is currently available for free download on the Google Play Store.
    If you have an iOS device or would like to play on a PC, you can play an
    <a href="/lightsout">online version</a> that doesn't have the minimum clicks
    implemented that I created using JavaScript. The Android Studio project,
    which includes the Java source code is available
    <a href="https://github.com/wmboyles/LightsOut"> on GitHub</a>.
