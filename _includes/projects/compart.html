    Visuals have always been an effective and fun way for me to learn,
    especially when the topic is abstract. The

    Python GUI libraries allow for simple image manipulation, down to the pixel
    level.

    For example, the mostly black image below visualizes how numbers change
    after a given number of iterations in the unsolved Collatz conjecture; I
    like the chaotic look and contrasting colors so much that it has been my
    phone background for several years. Next is more artistic visualization,
    which applies a smeared watercolor effect to the same Collatz conjecture.

    One can also visualize more useful and common mathematical ideas. The first
    image below shows how horizontal and vertical lines in the complex plane are
    transformed under e^(1/z). You can see concentric cardioids. The next image
    below shows the graph of several common functions, like sine and the natural
    logarithm.

    The Turtle library allows one to trace out colored paths in an image, like
    the rainbow spiral below. Getting a little more advanced, one can create
    recursive shapes, like the Koch Snowflake, Seirpinski Triangle, and dragon
    curve, shown below.

    One can also make other startlingly complex images from a simple set of
    recursive rules. The below images, known collectively as "strange
    attractors," show a tree, Barnsley Fern, pine branch and piece of tall
    grass. The procedural generation techniques used to create these images,
    known as L-systems, which can in many of today's popular video games to make
    random, realistic terrain and plants.

    used to create them, are available on
