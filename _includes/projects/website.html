<!-- Personal Website -->

<p class="lead">
    I created my website to provide more in-depth information about me and my projects than can fit onto a
    resume. Along the way, I learned a lot about web development and how to use various tools.
</p>

<h4 class="text-uppercase text-black">Beginning</h4>
<p class="lead">
    The first iteration of my site was completely handwritten HTML and CSS. Although some people like the minimalism of
    these sorts of sites and made them work really well (<a href="https://elihunter173.com/">shoutout to Eli</a>), it
    wasn't for me. The site was ugly and completely broken on mobile devices.
</p>

<h4 class="text-uppercase text-black">Bootstrap</h4>
<p class="lead">
    I started using <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> for its nice styles that are
    designed to work on mobile devices. Bootstrap gave the website the general "look" that it still has today. It also
    It also enabled some neat features, like a collapsible navbar. I still use Bootstrap today to do nearly all of the
    styling.

<h4 class="text-uppercase text-black">Jekyll</h4>
<p class="lead">
    As the number of pages on my site grew, I was becoming increasingly frustrated when I needed to make small changes,
    like fixing a link in the navbar. I'd have to manually go and correct the link on each page the navbar appeared.
    I was wasting too much time on redundant code and was too prone to make mistakes. To remedy this, I use <a
        href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to generate the site for me. Jekyll's template and include features
    allow me to only have the information that is unique to each page in a file. Now when updating the navbar, I only
    need to change the navbar file, and I'll see the same change on every page that includes the navbar.

<h4 class="text-uppercase text-black">Deployment</h4>
<p class="lead">
    Originally, I bought my domain through Google Domains for $12/yr. I could statically host my site on GitHub Pages,
    which works well with Jekyll. However, when Google announced in June 2023 it was <a
        href="https://support.google.com/domains/answer/13689670?sjid=3097287354605147452-NA">selling Domains to
        Squarespace</a>, I decided to investigate using Azure. Having my domain in Azure also made it easy for me to
    give third-level domains to my projects, like <a href="/projects/azurephotos">AzurePhotos</a> at <a
        href="https://photos.wmboyles.net">photos.wmboyles.net</a>. I wasn't able to transfer ownership of my domain
    from Google to Azure, so wmboyles.<i>com</i> because wmboyles.<i>net</i>. The domain itself still costs $12/yr, but
    there are also about $0.50/month from charges associated with the DNS zone. Since I have some free monthly Azure
    credits from work, migrating saved me money out of pocket.
