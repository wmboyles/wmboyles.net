<h3 class="text-uppercase text-black">Problem</h3>
<p>
  "You're at 80% of your storage quota," Google warned me yet again. With only
  17GB total of Drive space, I'd reach 100% in a few short months. What could I
  do when each of my photos could be 10MB, and I refuse to let my precious
  photos be compressed to "Storage Saver" quality? Google of course had a
  solution: Buy one of their Google One plans. For the best deal, pay $100 and
  get 2TB of storage (and some other features) for the year. However, armed with
  $150/month of Azure credits from work, I knew I could build a more
  cost-effective solution and learn more about Azure along the way.

<h3 class="text-uppercase text-black">Design</h3>
<p>
  Copying advanced features like photo editing and object recognition from
  Google Photos is not feasible. However, the basic features I need, such as
  uploading, viewing, and deleting photos, are available. By utilizing a storage
  account, I can store up to 2TiB of photos and even enable geo-backup for an
  additional cost, ensuring data replication to another data center. The UI is
  served through a Flask Web App. Azure facilitates a secure login flow via my
  Microsoft account, ensuring authentication for all requests to my app by
  storing a secret in a Key Vault and enabling login integration. The Web App
  communicates with the storage account using the
  <a
    href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-python"
    >azure-storage-blob</a
  >
  Python library, allowing photo uploads, fetching, and deletion. Furthermore,
  the library can generate time-based user-delegated keys, enabling direct
  serving of photos from the storage account without the risk of exposing
  connection strings.

  I encountered two performance issues that significantly slowed down the page
  loading. First, the page attempted to load all images in the storage account,
  even if the user hadn't scrolled far enough to view them. Fortunately, by
  utilizing the <code>loading="lazy"</code> attribute for <code>imgs</code>,
  requests for images are only made when they are close to entering the user's
  view. Second, the page requested full-sized images from the storage account,
  resulting in downloading at least a dozen files as large as 10MB each when the
  page ran. To address this, I implemented an Azure Function that detects
  newly-uploaded images and generates smaller thumbnails for the web app to
  display. When a user clicks on a thumbnail, the app presents the full-sized
  image in a larger view. While I could have integrated the resizing directly
  into the WebApp to execute upon image upload, I opted to experiment with Azure
  Functions. Even on the free tier, my function resizes images in under 1
  second.

<h3 class="text-uppercase text-black">Costs</h3>
<p>
  My solution costs about $0.42 per day at rest, and $1.00 per day when in use.
  Although this cost is a small part of my credits budget, it is
  considerably more expensive than Google One. More than half the cost is just
  from running the web app. If it weren't necessary for the web app to be
  constantly active, I could switch to the free tier App Service Plan.
  Additionally, disabling the geo-backup option on the storage account would
  significantly reduce most of the bandwidth expenses. If I could eliminate or
  distribute these costs among multiple users like Google does, I would be able
  to compete with Google One's pricing.

<h3 class="text-uppercase text-black">Learnings &amp; Future Enhancements</h3>
<p>
  I wouldn't recommend trying to build your own cloud photo storage solution
  unless you don't care about advanced features and have free Azure credits.
  However, as a learning experience, I know much more about setting up multiple
  Azure components, deploying code to them, and using secure, credential-free
  authentication.

<p>
  I can add more features similar to Google Photos, such as chronological
  ordering and album creation. Furthermore, I can utilize the user-delegated key
  functionality to enable sharing links to photos that automatically expire
  after a specific time. As for a more advanced capability, I have already
  prototyped image embedding techniques to identify near-duplicates, allowing
  users to keep only one copy. You can find the notebook and all other project
  code on
