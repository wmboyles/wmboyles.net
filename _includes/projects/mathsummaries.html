    While taking a summer physics class dealing with multivariable calculus, I
    realized how much of the subject I had already forgotten even though I took
    a multivariable calculus class (Calc III) only nine months earlier. I also
    knew that several of my friends who would be taking Calc III in the coming
    semesters, and they had already requested my notes from and help with the
    class.

    However, my hurriedly-taken, handwritten notes could be sometimes incomplete
    and hard to read. Plus, I like to keep my handwritten notes as a reference.
    I decided to digitize my notes using
    <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/" target="_blank">LaTeX</a>
    into an abridged textbook structure. I would also add better visual aids
    than the sketches in my notes. This way, I could easily share clear and
    legible notes with my friends, keep the original notes for myself, and
    refresh my own understanding while writing. By the time I was finished, I
    had condensed the several thousand page Calc III textbook into less than 100
    pages that covered all the important topics mentioned in class while still
    containing many visual aids, examples, full length proofs, and test
    questions.

    After completing my notes, I posted the results to
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/math/" target="_blank">r/math</a>, an
    online community of math enthusiasts of all levels. To my surprise, my post
    was incredibly well-received. Several users suggested I make my work open
    source so that others could help make corrections and suggest additions.

        >The repo</a
    >
    has already taken several community contributions.

    Putting the project on GitHub also helped me avoid mistakes and simplify my
    workflow. For example, when writing a text with equations, it's important
    that all sentences end with a period, including sentences that contain an
    equation. I had not been strict in observing this rule, but thanks to
    community contributions, I now have a Python script that finds and fixes
    these mistakes. Another issue solved in GitHub was thanking contributors. I
    wanted to include everyone that contributed to the project in the text, but
    I though it infeasible to have everyone on the title page as an author. I
    settled on adding a contributors section, but I didn't want to have users
    manually add their names, especially since many contributors did not know
    LaTeX. Instead, I wrote a Python script that would query the GitHub API, get
    all the most up to date list of project contributors and generate the LaTeX
    file. This script was integrated as a step in a Github Action that would
    also compile each work into a PDF so people could view the work without
    needing to compile the LaTeX themselves.

    Since then, I've begun expanding the scope of the project beyond
    multivariable calculus. The project now includes summaries of intro to
    differential equations, usually the next class after Calc III, and single
    variable calculus, which covers both Calc I and II.
</p>

<p>
    It has been incredibly heartwarming to see how many people appreciate my
    work and take enough interest to point out mistakes, make suggestions, and
    contribute. I hope to continue expanding this project as I take more math
    classes. I expect linear algebra will be the next topic I'll cover.
