<h3 class="text-uppercase text-black">Motivation</h3>
<p>
  During the summer of 2021, I spent a lot of my evenings studying for the GRE.
  I was especially struggling with vocabulary questions. Most of these questions
  are structured so that you are given a sentence with a word missing and must
  choose the correct word among five answer choices to logically complete the
  sentence. Although I tried to prepare by memorizing the definitions of words,
  I knew the best way to prepare would be to answer questions with the exact
  same structure as those on the exam. Unfortunately, there are a limited number
  of these questions available in test prep books. If I could get the most
  common GRE words and some example sentences using them, I could generate the
  questions myself.
</p>

<h3 class="text-uppercase text-black">Implementation</h3>
<p>
  First, I needed a list of words that commonly appear on the GRE. Thankfully,
  <a href="https://www.graduateshotline.com/gre/">GraduateShotOnline</a> has
  lists of over the 1300 most common GRE words. These are very easy to scrape
  using a tool like BeautifulSoup. Now that I had the words, I needed didactic
  sentences containing them like one would see in a dictionary. Companies like
  Webster's have APIs for their dictionaries, but they tend to either lack
  example sentences or require payment, which was not an option on my budget of
  nothing. Originially, I tried scraping the result of "define _____" from
  search engines. However, search engines purposely make their content hard to
  scrape to hinder competitors. Eventually I found
  <a href="https://api.dictionaryapi.dev">DictionaryAPI.dev</a> where I could
  get the same information one would see in an internet search without the
  difficulty or cost.
</p>

<p>
  I wrote the API in Python and the frontend in React. One could query the API
  to get a random question and answer pair. If one clicked an answer choice
  button and it was correct, the button would turn red. Otherwise, the button
  would turn green.

<h3 class="text-uppercase text-black">Deployment</h3>
<p>
  I deployed the app to Heroku because it was free. This project was a really
  great way to make a useful study tool while getting more hands-on with React.
  In the future, I might add different "gamemodes" or more ways to see with
  which words are the most difficult for each user. I plan to host the app on
  Azure soon, and can look at the code in
  <a href="https://github.com/wmboyles/VocabGREview">GitHub</a>.
